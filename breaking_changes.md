 - dutil now only has one maintained branch, the master which was merged with dgofork.
 - my discordgo fork's default branch is now yagpdb
 - Updated build scripts (docker and circle) as a result, if your docker script isnt working in the future this is most likely the reason if you have a old version of the docker build script
